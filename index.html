	<div>My first introduction to distributed version control was with Mercurial, whose commands come with a number of shortcuts (ci for commit, br to list branches, etc). A number of these shortcuts were muscle memory by the time I made the transition to Git, so I needed a way to port these various shortcuts over. Once again, Git promises to deliver in the form of aliases.
